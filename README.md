# Project Title

Interactive Map Application

## Description

This project is an interactive map application designed to provide users with dynamic mapping capabilities. It allows users to explore different locations, access detailed information about various points of interest, and possibly even plan routes. The application combines a React-based frontend for a responsive, user-friendly interface and a Node.js backend for efficient data handling and server-side logic.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you'll need Node.js installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://example.com/project.git cd project


Install server dependencies:

cd server npm install


Install client dependencies:

cd ../client npm install


### Running the applications

#### Running the server

Navigate to the server directory and run:

npm run dev


This will start the backend server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server upon any file changes.

#### Running the client

Navigate to the client directory and run:

npm run dev


This will start the React development server, and you should be able to access the interactive map application on `http://localhost:3000`.
